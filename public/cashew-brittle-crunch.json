  "description": "Candy makes everyone's holiday season that much merrier, which is why we're bringing you six delightful confections that'll transform any office or family gathering into a snow-capped wonderland. From toasted cashew brittle and peppermint-laced white chocolate bark to marshmallow-studded fudge and eggnog truffles, our dairy-free versions of winter classics are as easy to make as they are delicious to eat. We've even veganized divinity—a traditional Southern holiday dessert typically made with egg whites—using aquafaba to create a light and airy meringue-like texture. And don't worry, we won't tell if you decide not to leave any for Santa.",
